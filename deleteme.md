# Files and folders that can be removed

## /etc/sandbox/

This directory is an experimentation ground and you can remove it without
hesitation, but I advise you to read the contents first. Perhaps you will find
something useful or interesting there.

Luapi examples should be runned from project **root**:
`etc/sandbox/luapi_test/run.lua`.
