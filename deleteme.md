# Files and folders that should be removed

## /src/

`/src` directory contains example(s) and in real project all its content should
be replaced with your source code.

Examples should be runned from project **root**: `src/example.lua`.

## /etc/sandbox/

This directory is an experimentation ground and you can remove it without
hesitation, but I advise you to read the contents first. Perhaps you will find
something useful or interesting there.
