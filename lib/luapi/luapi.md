# LUAPI (WIP)

**LUAPI** is an attempt to bring together the best features of all lua
documentation tools I know, such as: [ldoc][], [luadoc][], [emmylua][] and
[scriptum][].

It generates code documentation in markdown format and also in the future I
really want to add autocomplete support for some IDE(s).

## Demo

Almost all `readme.md` files including this one was generated using `lib.luapi`.
Check out `init.lua` files to see how it works. Full "stress tests" you can
find [here](../../etc/sandbox/luapi_test).

## Tags

- `>`: function argument or table field
- `<`: function return
- `@`: mark block as "class" and set its name/reqpath (can be only one in block)
- first word after tag: variable name (or reqpath if tag is `@`)
- `(parentheses)`: variable type name or parent class reqpath
- `[square brackets]`: default value of the variable (makes it _optional_)
- last words: one line comment (title)

Quick example:

```lua
--[[ Some function title
Some function comment.
Can be multiline.
_Support_ **markdown**.
> str (string) some string comment
> num (number) [2] some number comment
< con (string) result of concatenation
]]
local function example(str, num)
  num = num or 2
  return str .. num
end
```

For more examples see source code of all this project ðŸ˜‰.

## Concept

Storing each module in a separate directory is a very good practice because it
allows you to keep together with the lua files not only the documentation but
also any other files on which this module depends, such as sounds, images, and
whatever else. It makes your modules more portable and independent and also its
pretty nice to see readme exactly under the files in your git-repository
website. That's why documentation generates only from `init.lua` files and saves
output `readme.md` in the same directory. File called `example.lua` from the
same directory will be included into `readme.md` (you can use such files not
only as examples, but also as simple unit-tests).

You can document all your code, but keep in mind that luapi will only parse
**classes**. If there is no classes in the file or file name is not `init.lua`,
it will be skipped. Class is `--[[...]]` comments block with the tag `@` inside.
Module (or "ClassMod") is the special class which does not require `@` tag and
is recognized by the variable returned at the end of the file. But if the file
does not return a documented variable, then the **first** class in file will be
considered a module.

## Types

When declaring a variable type, you can use all the built-in lua types or actual
variable values, plus the types listed below (keep in mind that equal sign works
different in different types):

+ **any** for any type
+ **integer** for non float number
+ **list** for tables with integer keys
+ **list=function|table** list **of** functions **or** tables
+ **{string=number|string}** table with **one** key=value
+ **{1=string,"size"=32}** similar example of two key=values
+ **{string=string...}** any number of key=values
+ **{integer=any...}** this example is equivalent to **list**

Also you can use your defined module require paths as types:

+ **lib.luapi.conf** some class or module
+ **table=lib.luapi.conf** table that has the same fields as class or module,
  but it is not necessarily an instance of it

You can't use classnames as types because they are not unique.

## Style guide

These rules are _optional_, but highly recommended:

+ maximum line number is **80** characters
+ `any` comments must always start with **uppercase** letter
+ `one line` comments (titles) must **not** have a dot or semicolon at the end
+ `muliline` comments (descriptions) must **have** a dot or semicolon at the end

These rules are _important_:

+ never call files in your project `readme.md` because these files will be
  generated automatically; use `current_directory_name.md` instead (its
  content will be included into `readme.md` in the generation process)
