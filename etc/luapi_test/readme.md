## This file is sandbox for testing luapi

Some readme...

The `etc` directory is an experimentation ground and you can remove it
without hesitation, but I advise you to read the contents first. Perhaps you
will find something useful or interesting there.

### How to run

1. cd to the project **root**
2. if `/bin/lua` existed then just run: `etc/luapi_test/run.lua`
3. if your lua binary located in another place, put it before the command above
