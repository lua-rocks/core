# Core libs - emmylua edition

I originally planned to create this branch for adapting `luapi` to `emmylua`,
for use it in vscode|vscodium together with the sumneko.lua extension. But
firstly this is quite a complicated task, and secondly the cheatsheet in the
`doc` directory is enough to get all documentation inside the editor, so if I
continue to develop luapi in this direction, then not in near future.
